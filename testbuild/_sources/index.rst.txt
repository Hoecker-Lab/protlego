Welcome to ProtLego! An Open-source Python Library for Chimera Design and Analysis
==================================================================================
ProtLego is a tool that enables constructing protein chimeras and its structural analysis.
ProtLego is writen in Python, so it facilitates that other scientists can extend it to their needs.

With ProtLego, it is possible to go from a pair of PDBs that share a structural fragment in common, to build
all possible chimeras between the two, rank them with the AMBER or CHARMM molecular mechanics forcefields,
and analyze their structural features (hydrogen networks, salt bridges, hydrophobic clusters...etc.)
